# Incident Handler’s Journal: Documenting Cybersecurity Incidents and Tools
- **Date:** July 2024
- **Overview:** Documented a series of cybersecurity activities in an incident handler’s journal, including a ransomware incident, network traffic analysis, and file hash investigation.
- **What I Did:**
  - **Entry #1 (Ransomware Incident):** Documented a ransomware attack at a health care company caused by a phishing attack. Unethical hackers encrypted critical files and demanded a ransom. The company shut down systems to contain the incident and sought external help for eradication and recovery.
  - **Entry #2 (Wireshark Packet Analysis):** Used Wireshark to analyze a packet capture file, learning how to detect malicious activity through network traffic analysis.
  - **Entry #3 (tcpdump Packet Capture):** Used tcpdump to capture network traffic via the command-line interface, overcoming challenges with syntax to successfully complete the task.
  - **Entry #4 (VirusTotal File Hash Investigation):** Investigated a suspicious file hash using VirusTotal, identifying a malicious file attachment sent via email to an employee at a financial services company.
- **Skills Used:**
  - Incident response and documentation.
  - Network traffic analysis with Wireshark and tcpdump.
  - Investigative analysis with VirusTotal.
