# Cybersecurity Portfolio
Hi, I’m Durgolla ravi, a BCA student at Manipal University Jaipur. This portfolio showcases my cybersecurity projects from the Google Cybersecurity Professional Certificate and case studies.

## Skills
- Cybersecurity Frameworks: NIST CSF
- Tools: Wireshark, tcpdump, VirusTotal, Splunk, Nmap
- Programming: Python, SQL
- Operating Systems: Linux (file permissions, command-line)
- Concepts: Incident Response, Vulnerability Assessment, Network Traffic Analysis

## Portfolio Overview
This portfolio contains 13 projects completed as part of the Google Cybersecurity Professional Certificate. These projects cover incident response, network analysis, vulnerability assessments, SQL data analysis, Python automation, and more.

## Projects
- **Internal IT Audit for Botium Toys**: Performed an audit using NIST CSF, identified risks, and ensured compliance with PCI DSS and GDPR.
- **Analyzing Network Structure and Security**: Used Wireshark to analyze network traffic and proposed mitigation strategies.
- **Using Linux Commands to Manage File Permissions**: Secured files using Linux commands like chmod and chown.
- **Applying Filters to SQL Queries**: Filtered data securely using SQL SELECT and WHERE clauses.
- **Identifying Vulnerabilities for a Small Business**: Conducted a vulnerability assessment using Nmap.
- **Documenting Incidents with an Incident Handler’s Journal**: Documented a simulated incident using Splunk.
- **Importing and Parsing a Text File in a Security-Related Scenario**: Analyzed security logs by parsing a text file.
- **Incident Report Analysis: DDoS Attack Response**: Analyzed a DDoS attack incident using NIST CSF and suggested improvements.
- **Managing File Permissions for Research Team**: Checked and updated file permissions using Linux commands to match authorization rules.
- **Investigating Security Issues Using SQL Filters**: Used SQL queries to investigate login attempts and employee machines for security issues.
- **Vulnerability Assessment: Publicly Accessible Database Server**: Assessed risks of a publicly accessible database server and suggested solutions.
- **Incident Handler’s Journal: Documenting Cybersecurity Incidents and Tools**: Documented a ransomware incident, Wireshark, tcpdump, and VirusTotal usage in a journal.
- **Automating IP Address Removal with Python**: Created a Python algorithm to update an allow list by removing unauthorized IP addresses.
