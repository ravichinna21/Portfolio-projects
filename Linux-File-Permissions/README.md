# Managing File Permissions for Research Team
- **Date:** March 2025
- **Overview:** As a security professional, I ensured the research team’s file permissions matched the organization’s authorization rules to keep the system secure.
- **What I Did:**
  - Used `ls -la` to check permissions in the projects directory, including files (project_k.txt, .project_x.txt) and directories (drafts).
  - Analyzed permissions strings (ex: -rw-rw-r--) to understand user, group, and other access.
  - Updated permissions using `chmod` to match authorization:
    - Removed write access for "other" on project_k.txt (`chmod o-w project_k.txt`).
    - Removed write access for user and group on .project_x.txt, added read access for group (`chmod u-w,g-w,g+r .project_x.txt`).
    - Removed execute access for group on drafts directory (`chmod g-x drafts`) to restrict access to researcher2 user only.
- **Skills Used:**
  - Linux commands (ls, chmod) for file permission management.
  - Authorization analysis to ensure secure access.
  - Attention to detail in analyzing permissions strings.
- **Findings:**
  - Identified unauthorized access: "other" had write access to project_k.txt, group had execute access to drafts directory.
  - Hidden file .project_x.txt had incorrect permissions for an archived file.
- **Results:**
  - Updated permissions to match organization rules, ensuring only authorized users (ex: researcher2) have access.
  - Improved system security by removing unauthorized access.
