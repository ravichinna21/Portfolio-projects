# Investigating Security Issues Using SQL Filters
- **Date:** March 2025
- **Overview:** As a security professional, I investigated potential security issues in my organization by analyzing login attempts and employee machines using SQL filters.
- **What I Did:**
  - Queried the log_in_attempts table to investigate login attempts:
    - Filtered failed login attempts after 18:00 (`WHERE login_time > '18:00' AND success = FALSE`).
    - Filtered login attempts on 2022-05-09 and 2022-05-08 (`WHERE login_date = '2022-05-09' OR login_date = '2022-05-08'`).
    - Filtered login attempts outside Mexico (`WHERE country NOT LIKE 'MEX%'`).
  - Queried the employees table to collect data for machine updates:
    - Filtered Marketing department employees in the East building (`WHERE department = 'Marketing' AND office LIKE 'East%'`).
    - Filtered Finance and Sales department employees (`WHERE department = 'Finance' OR department = 'Sales'`).
    - Filtered employees not in the Information Technology department (`WHERE department NOT LIKE 'Information Technology'`).
- **Skills Used:**
  - SQL query writing (SELECT, WHERE, AND, OR, NOT, LIKE, % wildcard).
  - Data analysis for security investigation.
  - Attention to detail in filtering specific datasets.
- **Findings:**
  - Identified potential security issues: Failed login attempts after hours, suspicious logins on specific dates, and logins from outside Mexico.
  - Collected data for employee machine updates in Marketing, Finance, Sales, and non-IT departments.
- **Results:**
  - Provided insights into potential security risks for further investigation.
  - Enabled targeted machine updates for employees in specific departments, improving system security.
