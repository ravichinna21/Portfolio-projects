- **Date:** March 2025
- **Overview:** As a cybersecurity analyst at an e-commerce company, I conducted a vulnerability assessment of a publicly accessible remote database server used by employees to query customer data.
- **What I Did:**
  - Identified the vulnerability: The database server has been open to the public for three years, allowing unauthorized access.
  - Assessed risks: Unauthorized access, data breaches, data manipulation, DoS attacks, and regulatory non-compliance.
  - Evaluated impact: Financial losses, reputation damage, operational disruption, and legal consequences.
  - Suggested solutions to secure the server and mitigate risks.
- **Skills Used:**
  - Vulnerability assessment and risk analysis.
  - Knowledge of data security best practices and regulations (ex: GDPR).
  - Analytical thinking to recommend actionable solutions.
- **Findings:**
  - The publicly accessible server poses risks like data breaches, DoS attacks, and GDPR non-compliance (fines up to â‚¬20 million or 4% of annual turnover).
  - Potential impact includes financial losses, reputation damage, and operational disruptions.
- **Recommendations:**
  - Restrict public access using IP whitelisting and a VPN.
  - Implement strong authentication (username/password, MFA).
  - Encrypt data at rest and in transit using TLS/SSL.
  - Set up a firewall to block unauthorized access.
  - Monitor activity with tools like Splunk and conduct regular audits.
  - Keep software updated and maintain secure backups.
